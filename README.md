### Pokémon Walking Algorithm (Working Title)
===
 
**Abstract:**
Implements the walking algorithm used in classic Pokémon G/S/C games.

**Note:** *It does not mimic the walking algorithm used in Pokémon R/B/Y games (1st generation games).*

===
**Description:**
This is a project I am currently working on while I'm doing conscription service. The aim of this project is to port the walking algorithm used in the 2nd generation games of the official Pokémon game series. At the moment, I'm leaving out the 1st generation walking algorithm, as the 2nd generation games introduced "turning on the spot".

If all bodes well, it's possible that this will become a Java port of the Pokémon 2nd generation games. Highly likely, but I don't want to get my hopes up too soon.

It's still in very early stages of development. Possibly even earlier than "alpha".

*Everything is done from scratch/by hand. Only the character design is mostly copied from the original Pokémon games.*

**Features:**
* Walking. (Main theme of the entire project.)
* Area warping. (Complete.)
* Ledges to jump! (Complete.)
* Overworld to explore! (Beta.)
* Stairs! (Complete.)
* Primitive Ground Height Lighting (Testing stages.)
* Water! (Beta)
* Bitmap animation! (Complete!)

**Known Issues:**
* (NEW) There may be issues with the tiles-to-tiles interaction, causing unwanted bugs.
* (NEW) There may be hidden issues I haven't seen/know of yet.

**Plans:**
* Implement all walking situations from the original games. Walking, surfing, jumping over ledges, riding bicycle, etc. (Main goal)
* (NEW) Create a game completely different from Pokémon games. (Extended Plan, won't guarantee it.)

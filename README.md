### Pokémon Walking Algorithm (Working Title) 

===

**Abstract:**

Implements the walking algorithm used in classic Pokémon G/S/C games. Also includes a level editor to create your own game areas.

===

**Description:**

This is a project I am currently working on while I'm doing conscription service. The aim of this project is to port the walking algorithm used in the 2nd generation games of the official Pokémon game series. At the moment, I'm leaving out the 1st generation walking algorithm, as the 2nd generation games introduced "turning on the spot".

If all bodes well, it's possible that this will become a Java port of the Pokémon 2nd generation games. Highly likely, but I don't want to get my hopes up too soon.

It's still in very early stages of development. Possibly even earlier than "alpha". *Everything is done from scratch/by hand. Only the character design is mostly mimicked from the original Pokémon games.*

*MILESTONE HAS REACHED, ALL PRIORITIES ARE SHIFTED TO LOW!* That means I won't be working on this as active as I used to be, but it is still in development. Note that it does not mimic the walking algorithm used in Pokémon R/B/Y games (1st generation games). I also no longer put new releases here at GitHub, due to the lack of showing downloads count.



===

**Features:**

| In development | Beta (Close to completion) | Complete |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Entity Interaction | Overworld | All Movements* |
| Ground Height Lighting | Dialogues | Ledges |
| ??? | Level Editor | Area Warping |
| | ??? | Stairs |
| | | Water |
| | | Bitmap Animation |
| | | Item Balls |
| | | Inventory |

\*All movements: Walking, Facing/Turning, Surfing, Bicycling, Jumping, etc.

===

**Known Issues:**

* There may be issues with the tiles-to-tiles interaction, causing unwanted bugs.
* There may be hidden issues I haven't seen/know of yet.
* All items will exit out of inventory.

===

**Plans:**

* ~~Implement all walking situations from the original games. Walking, surfing, jumping over ledges, riding bicycle, etc. (MAIN GOAL)~~  (MILESTONE COMPLETE!)
* Create a game completely different from Pokémon games. (Extended Plan, low priority, low activity, won't guarantee completion.)

Abstract [PWD01]

Port of Pokémon walking movements from old-generation 
Pokémon games. Nothing else is going to be ported to
this project, such as battling, and official Pokémon
related activities the official released versions do
provide us with.

-------------------------------

About the Project [PWD02]

The project is a port of the walking algorithm used 
in 2nd generation Pokémon games. There are no future
plans to add the 1st generation walking algorithm into
this project.

All arts are entirely placeholder. Some of the artwork
may be here to stay.

	History [PWD02#01]

The concept was created out of spite. The developer,
tom_mai78101, felt that there was no easy way of
creating custom dialogues and characters to share to
others for jokes and fun. He does not want to learn
to hack Pokémon games just for such a simple task, 
but the developer could not put down the idea.

Frustrated, the developer created "Pokémon Dialogue
Editor," which is this project's first tentative
title.

Then, bored and lacking a plan, the developer moved on
to create "Pixavive Survival," a real-time 2D pixel
strategy game. 

Packed with new ideas and tricks, the developer went
back to this project and decided to redo the drawing
board, but came to a halt. Even with new ideas, the
developer could not come up with something original
that can be used in this project.

Looking back to the past, the developer decided to do
something more simple. Something that has to do with
Pokémon, and it has to be easy to see. It turns out to
be the game genre, role-playing game.

Rewriting the game engine, the developer created a
working application, where the player controls an
object using arrow keys as input. The developer wanted
to have a retro feel when the player is exploring what
was then an empty, blank canvas. The first thing that
sprung up was the walking algorithm Pokémon games used.

The developer first created tiles and placeholder art
used as obstacles. For the obstacles, the collision 
detection and response came from "Pixavive Survival."
Then comes the player, which was mostly copied from
Pokémon character sprite designs. It's really hard to
draw a human in a 16x16 square, especially when trying
to make human body parts apparent and easy to tell.

At first, the developer thought the Pokémon character
that was created is going to be a placeholder art until
the end of this project. Overtime, the developer started
to like the character design, and decided to keep it in,
and move on to working on the walking algorithm.

Once the developer implemented the walking algorithm,
it became apparent that the walking algorithm requires
tons and tons of tweaking and fixing bugs. This has led
to many full releases at an early stage of development.

It was also during that time, the new and second 
tentative title, "Pokémon Walking algorithm," stuck.

The history of the early development can be read here 
from the link given below, with each of the releases and
their respective source codes being available for
download:

It was not until the developer sees having a GitHub repo
is crucial, that moving the entire project to an online
server becomes neccesary. At v5, the move was completed.

At v6, it was finally ready for public release to a more
larger group of people, namely game programmers.

It was not until v7 did all the known issues have been
fixed. Now, the developer is currently busy with the
military service, and will update the project from time
to time.

Groups [PWD03]

This section contains class objects that were deemed to
have multiple properties. They are grouped together for
easier maintaining and adding new features for future
planning.

Each section is separated into group labels, with their
usages and functions all explained. Refer to this
section when adding/modifying/removing functions and
their data format, since this section will be modified
accordingly.

All of these groups have not been finalized so far. Do
not assume their information to be permanent.
